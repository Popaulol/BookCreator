# Book Creator

This thing converts a PDF File of A4 Pages to one that can be used with double sided priting to create an A5 booklet.

The UI, whilst horrid, should be self explanitory.

## Setup
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install PyPDF2:

This does depend on your system Setup but
```
pip install PyPDF2
```
*Should* work on Winshit, CrackOS and some Linux Distros.
If this doesn't work on your system, you can probably figure out out to use Pip on your system.
