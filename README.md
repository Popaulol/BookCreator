# Book Creator

This thing converts a PDF File of A4 Pages to one that can be used with double sided priting to create an A5 booklet.

The UI, whilst horrid, should be self explanitory.

## Setup
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Install PyPDF2:

This does depend on your system Setup but
```
pip install PyPDF2
```
*Should* work on Winshit, CrackOS and some Linux Distros.
If this doesn't work on your system, you can probably figure out how to install soemthing from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) on your system yourself.


# Running
```
python3 main.py
```

If that doesn't work you system, go figure it out yourself.
